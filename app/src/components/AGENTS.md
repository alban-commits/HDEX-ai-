# Shared app components — the cross-app contract

These components are the single source of truth for the core interactions
every Higgsfield app must share. **IMPORT them — never copy, fork, or
hand-roll a replacement.** Missing a prop? Extend the component here
(backward compatible); never build a private variant inside a route or layout.

<!-- shared:rules:begin — keep identical across all templates (scripts/check-agents-sync.sh) -->

## Hard rules (apply to EVERY app)

1. **Assets / uploads → `AssetLibraryModal`** behind EVERY "+" / upload /
   attach / add-media action — never a custom picker or upload modal. Trigger
   UI: `UploadField` in creation rails, `Dropzone` in the app-detail hero. In
   a real app it MUST be WIRED — `items`, `onUpload`, `onSelect`, and
   `pagination` (see "Wiring" below);
   shipping it unwired (demo grid, preview-only uploads) is a bug. Every large
   upload/select tile uses the canonical `UploadField` / `Dropzone` glass
   image-field style (Figma 3313:51149); never hand-roll or visually simplify
   this surface.
2. **One generation → `GenerationTile`** everywhere (feed tile, wizard result,
   hero result, variation cell). Busy = `state="generating"`; lightbox is
   always `GenerationDetailModal` (via the tile's `detail` prop); hover rail
   is `CardActions` (≤3 actions, rest in ⋯). Never hand-roll spinners, result
   tiles, hover overlays, or lightboxes. A `Grid` of tiles is ONLY for a
   finite "pick the best of these" set inside a wizard/generator — not a feed.
   Every action with `id: "download"` automatically downloads the generation's
   original image/video through `downloadMedia`; never ship a Download control
   without a real media URL.
3. **A browsable feed of the user's OWN generations → `UserGenerations`**
   (History, "all generations", after-generate results). Personal only —
   never a public/community feed. `@/components/gallery` is its private
   internals — never import it or hand-roll a masonry. `HistoryGrid` is a
   deprecated alias. Keep mapped `items` and load callbacks referentially
   stable. A client-filtered subset of a global cursor must use explicit
   paging instead of auto-loading the entire global history to fill itself.
4. **Pick-one-option choosers → `TemplateModal`** (presets, styles, any grid
   of selectable tiles).
5. **Progressive disclosure.** A panel shows only its PRIMARY inputs + the
   costed Generate CTA; every secondary choice collapses under a Quanta
   `Accordion` (`multiple={false}`) — never a flat always-open list, never a
   hand-rolled collapsible. Creation-rail budget: at most 3 large fields
   (`UploadField` / cover `MediaCard` / `Dropzone`) + 4 compact
   (`SettingTrigger` / `Select`) visible; the rail scrolls
   (`overflow-y-auto`) and the CTA stays pinned via `RailFooter`.
6. **Every visible action must work end-to-end.** Never render an inert button,
   placeholder handler, empty menu, or `onClick={() => {}}`. In
   `GenerationDetailModal` and `CardActions`: Download uses the real media URL;
   Like updates persisted liked state; Share uses Web Share with a clipboard
   fallback; Delete confirms and removes the persisted item; More opens a real
   menu whose rows are wired; and the primary CTA starts its actual generation
   workflow. If an action cannot be implemented, hide it instead of showing a
   dead control. Verify each action by clicking it before delivery.
7. **Generation identity must be real.** Every `GenerationDetailModal` receives
   `generation.author` from the authenticated profile or generation owner:
   `{ name, avatarSrc, role }`. For the current user's generations, use the
   current user's display name and avatar; use email/initials only as loading
   fallbacks. Never ship hardcoded demo identities such as `retro_strawberry`,
   a fake initial, or an unrelated avatar. Map the owner through `GalleryItem`
   into `GenerationTile` so the InfoPanel header always renders real identity.
8. **Screen empty states use `ScreenEmptyState`.** Every empty page/feed renders
   the shared dotted-fade composition with three representative generations
   from that app, plus real title/description and an optional working action.
   Never ship a text-only empty screen, generic illustration, or unrelated media.

## Design invariants (every screen)

- **No app header/top bar, no breadcrumbs, no credits/sign-out UI** — the
  Higgsfield host chrome owns those. In-app nav = Quanta `Sidebar` or inline
  controls; a page title is a heading in the content area.
- **Permanently DARK** — `data-theme="default-dark"` pinned in
  `src/routes/__root.tsx`; no theme toggle, no light mode, no `dark:` styling.
- **Container** `mx-auto w-full max-w-7xl` on the shell (exception: a
  full-bleed workspace shell like Studio).
- **Buttons** — variant names lie: `primary` = LIME, `secondary` = WHITE,
  `tertiary` = dark glass, `ghost` = transparent. Nav/ordinary actions use
  `tertiary`/`ghost`. The generation CTA is ALWAYS `marketingPrimary` with the
  cost inside: `{label} {sparkles} {credits}` (sparkle =
  `@/assets/icon-sparkles-soft.svg?react`, 14px; credits inherit the label
  font; `Loader size="xs" color="neutral"` while busy). Pass `size="md"`
  explicitly (Quanta defaults to `sm`); `sm`/`xs` only in dense toolbars.
- **Icons** — lucide only, by name, via the Quanta `Icon` wrapper
  (`import { Sparkle } from "lucide-react"` → `<Icon as={Sparkle} />`).
- **Prompt surfaces** — the shipped dock components (`Composer` / `PromptBox`;
  in the studio template the canonical dock is `StudioPromptBox`) — never
  hand-rolled.
- **Compose from Quanta + `cn`.** Gaps (date picker, table, …) → build a small
  component HERE from Quanta primitives + `q-` tokens. Never a third-party UI
  library, never modify or restyle the vendored `@higgsfield/quanta`.
- **Real copy in every state** (empty, busy, error) — no placeholder tokens.
- **Don't chase lint/type noise** — `bun run lint`/`typecheck` ship clean;
  anything reported is from YOUR changes. Never reformat shipped template
  files or vendored `packages/`.

## Preset tiles: horizontal or vertical orientation

Chosen **per app**, never hardcoded. Horizontal = 16:9 tiles, 3 columns;
vertical = 9:16, denser. Match the app's output (vertical for shorts/9:16
apps) and drive tile shape with `MediaCard`'s `ratio` prop rather than a
bespoke aspect ladder.

<!-- shared:wiring:begin — keep identical across all templates (scripts/check-agents-sync.sh) -->

## Wiring `AssetLibraryModal`

Trigger-based: your clickable element goes in `trigger`, the chosen asset
arrives in `onSelect`. Interactions (filtering, search, virtualized scrolling,
upload busy/error, select-and-close) work out of the box — a REAL app wires all
four live props:

- **`items: AssetLibraryItem[]`** — durable FNF media uploads plus mapped FNF
  generations, with `kind` (`"upload" | "image" | "video"`), `personal`,
  and optional `liked` metadata. Never mix uploads into generation history.
- **`onUpload: (file) => Promise<AssetSelection>`** — multipart `FormData`
  POST to the same-origin app route → `media.upload(...)` server-side → resolve
  `{ name, type, src, ref }`, where `ref` is the durable FNF `MediaRef`.
- **`onSelect: (item) => void`** — store the chosen item in controlled app
  state. Generation submits use `item.ref`, NEVER `item.src`; `src` can be
  a browser-local preview URL.
- **`pagination`** — independent cursor/loading/error/load-more state for each
  backed tab. Upload and generation cursors stay separate. Filtered search uses
  explicit pagination instead of silently fetching the whole account.

```tsx
const liveLibraryProps = {
  items: libraryItems,
  onUpload: (file: File) => uploadToMediaRoute(file),
  onSelect: (item: AssetSelection) => setSource(item),
  pagination: {
    uploads: uploadPage,
    image: imageGenerationPage,
    video: videoGenerationPage,
  },
};

<AssetLibraryModal
  {...liveLibraryProps}
  trigger={(
    <Dropzone
      render={<button type="button" />}
      icon={IconAddPhoto}
      title="Upload Image"
      subtitle="PNG, JPG or Paste from Clipboard"
      preview={image != null ? <DropzonePreview src={image} alt="Selected image" /> : undefined}
    />
  )}
/>

// Other trigger shapes keep the same live props:
<AssetLibraryModal {...liveLibraryProps} trigger={<PromptBox.Pill iconOnly aria-label="Add media" start={<Icon as={IconPlus} size="sm" />} />} />
<AssetLibraryModal {...liveLibraryProps} trigger={<Composer.Action start={<Icon size="sm" as={IconPlus} />}>Attach files</Composer.Action>} />
```

**Trigger silently not opening?** `trigger` renders AS the modal trigger
(Base UI `render` prop) — it must spread incoming props (`onClick`, `ref`,
aria) onto a real DOM node. Quanta and `@/components/*` all do; a custom
component that drops unknown props won't open. Fix: forward props, or wrap in
`<button type="button" className="contents">…</button>`.

## Generation lifecycle

One state machine everywhere: `idle → generating → result`.

```tsx
{
  stage === "generating" && <GenerationTile state="generating" ratio="portrait" />;
}
{
  stage === "result" && (
    <GenerationTile
      ratio="portrait"
      generation={{ src: resultUrl, mediaType: "image", prompt }}
      actions={[{ id: "download", label: "Download", icon: IconDownload }]}
    />
  );
}
```

Helpers in `src/lib/higgsfield-generation-results.ts` map a Generation to its
preview media. Backend wiring (submit, poll, uploads):
`app/packages/fnf-react/ai/AGENTS.md` — `useGenerationRun` drives the
`generating` prop, `useAttachments` uploads picked files.

## Adding a new shared component

Build it here from Quanta primitives + `q-` tokens (never a third-party UI
lib), export via `index.ts`, add a catalog row above.

## Placeholder demo assets

Shipped demo media (`/presets/*.png` + hardcoded demo data) is PLACEHOLDER
art, marked with greppable "PLACEHOLDER ASSETS" comments. In a real app,
replace product-representing media (hero/example outputs, covers,
before/after samples, feed items) with bespoke assets generated via the
Higgsfield tools. Style-picker label thumbnails may stay simple when real
output depends on the user's upload.

<!-- shared:wiring:end -->

## Preset scaffold demo-mode types

This template makes every silent demo fallback explicit:

- `AssetLibraryModal`: use `demo` only in the untouched scaffold; live usage
  must pass `items`, `onUpload`, `onSelect`, and `pagination`. The preset layout merges
  persisted `media.list` uploads with live generations. Keep video entries on
  `Media.Video` (a raw video URL is never an image source), and expose Liked
  only when the backend supplies real `liked` metadata. Cursor-page each live
  tab through its `pagination` entry (`hasMore`, `loading`, `error`,
  `onLoadMore`) so scrolling fetches only that tab. Never eager-load
  `size: 100` or collapse tab loading/error state into one global flag.
- `UserGenerations`: use `demo` only in the untouched scaffold; live usage must
  pass the current user's mapped `items`. Forward the cursor query's
  `hasMore`, `loadingMore`, and `onLoadMore` so its existing virtualized feed
  can page without replacing loaded media. Real items never append fake older
  batches.
- `TemplatePickerModal`: live usage must pass product-specific `items`; seeded
  template cards require explicit `demo`.
- `GenerationDetailModal`: live usage must pass `generation`; its demo media,
  metadata, and actions require explicit `demo`.

Do not silence the resulting TypeScript errors with casts or optional props.
They identify unfinished data wiring. The shipped preset layout already uses
the live-mode props; preserve that wiring and run `bun run check:adapted` before
completing an adapted app.
